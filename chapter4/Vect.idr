module MyVect

import Data.Fin
-- A Vect definition. This had initially confused me, because
-- you define the 'sub-types' as constructors.

-- It's both dependent, and recursive
data Vect : Nat -> Type -> Type where
     Nil : Vect Z a
     (::) : (x : a) -> (xs : Vect k a) -> Vect (S k) a

%name Vect xs, ys, zs

{-
I think that something that confused me in the past about Elm,
which also applies here, is that where you have a data type, the
constructor never applies to the data-type (parent type?). You
can't write Maybe 7, because the Maybe constructor takes a type
to return a type.

I believe that Scala confused me, because it uses X.apply, which
will be a function that returns an instance with a specific type.
So in `val opt: Option[Int] = Option(6)` you have two separate
entities, a type Option[Int] and a function invocation, which is
**not** the type's constructor. The only constructors are still
Nil and Some(_)
